    "I've been working with React for about 3 years now. I've built several projects including e-commerce platforms and dashboards. I'm particularly experienced with hooks and context API.",
    "For smaller applications, I typically use React's Context API. For more complex state management needs, I prefer Redux or sometimes Redux Toolkit to simplify boilerplate code. I also have experience with MobX for certain use cases.",
    "Recently I had to optimize a component that was causing performance issues. I implemented React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary rerenders, which improved the performance by about 40%.",
    "I believe in the principle of component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. I focus on writing self-documenting code with meaningful variable names and following established patterns. I'm also a fan of TypeScript for type safety."
